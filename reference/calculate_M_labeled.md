## Usage

``` r
calculate_M_labeled(M, W_lab_mean, W_unlab_mean)
```

## Arguments

- M:

  (*numeric*) Molecular weight of the unlabeled feature

- W_lab_mean:

  (*numeric*) WAD (or mean WAD) value of the labeled feature

- W_unlab_mean:

  (*numeric*) WAD (or mean WAD) value of the unlabeled feature

## Value

`M_labeled` is the molecular weight of the labeled feature
